# An Adaptive Dynamic Mixing Model for sEMG Real-Time ICA on an Ultra-Low Power Processor

## Introduction
Code to reproduce our paper "An Adaptive Dynamic Mixing Model for sEMG Real-Time ICA on an Ultra-Low Power Processor" [1].

## Environment setup
The code is compatible with Python 3.7+. To create and activate the Python environment, run the following commands:
```
python -m venv <ENV_NAME>
source <ENV_NAME>/bin/activate
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook [`Adaptive Decomposition of sEMG signals.ipynb`](https://github.com/pulp-bio/adaptive-bss-semg/blob/main/Adaptive%20Decomposition%20of%20sEMG%20signals.ipynb) 
to perform both the offline calibration and the online adaptation.
